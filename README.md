The sole purpose of this repo is to [link my GitHub and Mastodon identities](https://til.simonwillison.net/mastodon/verifying-github-on-mastodon). In lay terms, that means my GitHub page link is verified on my Mastodon profile.

If you want to do the same, simply fork this repo and replace everything `jdrch` with `YourGitHubUsername` and of course my Mastodon user profile link with yours. Then add `YourGitHubUsername.github.io` to your Mastodon profile.
